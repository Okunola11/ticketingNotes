## Conclusion and Learning

Throughout the development of this project, I have gained valuable insights and experience in various aspects of software development. Some of the key learnings include:

- **Redux Toolkit and RTK Query:** I extensively used Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for state management and data fetching, learning their best practices and optimizations.
  
- **Workflow Between Backend and Frontend:** I deepened my understanding of the workflow between backend and frontend development, ensuring seamless integration and data communication.

- **Backend API Development:** I successfully created the backend API for this project, gaining hands-on experience in designing and implementing RESTful APIs.

These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also equipped me with practical knowledge applicable to real-world projects. I look forward to applying these learnings in future endeavors and continuing to grow as a software developer.
